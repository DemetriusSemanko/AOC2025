# Advent of Code (2025)
## No AI guarantee
### Demetrius Semanko
I make this guarantee because I see AI as a distraction from pure, cathartic programming.
One might find AI incredibly "useful"; I find it not. AI confers upon the industry little boosts in productivity.
What AI has done to programming compares roughly to what social media has done to our brains: lobotomy.

The tool, flaunted by executives and project leads the world over, leads to negligible, if not non-existent,
productivity improvements all while producing, to quote the Harvard Business Review, "workslop".
The reality of the industry means I have to pretend to "like" AI so I may come across as "useful".

Using it to Google things might come across as having the most efficacy for any programmer, but AI hallucinations are
not uncommon. AI appears smart, so the user feels smart when using it. **Do not turn your brain off**.

Happy programming.
